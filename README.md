# Scientific-Computing-with-Python-Build-a-Time-Calculator-Project

This repository contains my solution to the **Build a Time Calculator** project from freeCodeCamp’s [Scientific Computing with Python].  The goal of this project is to create a Python function that adds a duration to a start time and returns the result in a readable format.

## To complete this project, you should be comfortable with:

- 🧮 **Variables** — assigning and using data in Python  
- 📦 **Lists** — storing, accessing, and iterating over collections  
- ✂️ **String manipulation** — slicing, formatting, and aligning text  
- 🧵 **f-strings** — for clean and readable string interpolation  
- 🔍 **Regular expressions** — for pattern matching and input validation  
- 🔁 **Recursion** — understanding how functions can call themselves to solve problems

  ## Purpose

This code is shared for educational purposes — to help others learn, reflect, and improve their Python skills.  
Feel free to explore the logic, test edge cases, and use it as a reference for time-based string formatting.
